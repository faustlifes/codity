  /** 1779. Find Nearest Point That Has the Same X or Y Coordinate
   You are given two integers, x and y, which represent your current location on a Cartesian grid: (x, y). You are also given an array points where each points[i] = [ai, bi] represents that a point exists at (ai, bi). A point is valid if it shares the same x-coordinate or the same y-coordinate as your location.
   Return the index (0-indexed) of the valid point with the smallest Manhattan distance from your current location. If there are multiple, return the valid point with the smallest index. If there are no valid points, return -1.
   The Manhattan distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2).
   Example 1:
   Input: x = 3, y = 4, points = [[1,2],[3,1],[2,4],[2,3],[4,4]]
   Output: 2
   Explanation: Of all the points, only [3,1], [2,4] and [4,4] are valid. Of the valid points, [2,4] and [4,4] have the smallest Manhattan distance from your current location, with a distance of 1. [2,4] has the smallest index, so return 2.
   Example 2:
   Input: x = 3, y = 4, points = [[3,4]]

   Explanation: The answer is allowed to be on the same location as your current location.

   * Given a wordlist, we want to implement a spellchecker that converts a query word into a correct word.
   * For a given query word, the spell checker handles two categories of spelling mistakes:
   * Capitalization: If the query matches a word in the wordlist (case-insensitive), then the query word is returned with the same case as the case in the wordlist.
   * Example: wordlist = ["yellow"], query = "YellOw": correct = "yellow"
   * Example: wordlist = ["Yellow"], query = "yellow": correct = "Yellow"
   * Example: wordlist = ["yellow"], query = "yellow": correct = "yellow"
   * Vowel Errors: If after replacing the vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') of the query word with any vowel individually, it matches a word in the wordlist (case-insensitive), then the query word is returned with the same case as the match in the wordlist.
   * Example: wordlist = ["YellOw"], query = "yollow": correct = "YellOw"
   * Example: wordlist = ["YellOw"], query = "yeellow": correct = "" (no match)
   * Example: wordlist = ["YellOw"], query = "yllw": correct = "" (no match)
   * In addition, the spell checker operates under the following precedence rules:
   * When the query exactly matches a word in the wordlist (case-sensitive), you should return the same word back.
   * When the query matches a word up to capitlization, you should return the first such match in the wordlist.
   * When the query matches a word up to vowel errors, you should return the first such match in the wordlist.
   * If the query has no matches in the wordlist, you should return the empty string.
   * Given some queries, return a list of words answer, where answer[i] is the correct word for query = queries[i].
   * Example 1:
   *   Input: wordlist = ["KiTe","kite","hare","Hare"], queries = ["kite","Kite","KiTe","Hare","HARE","Hear","hear","keti","keet","keto"]
   *   Output: ["kite","KiTe","KiTe","Hare","hare","","","KiTe","","KiTe"]

   * For example, the word "apple" becomes "applema".
   * If a word begins with a consonant (i.e., not a vowel), remove the first letter and append it to the end, then add "ma".
